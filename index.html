        <h1>Hello, Mars!</h1>
        <div class="solar-punk-theme">
            <p>Welcome to Mars! Imagine a world where technology and nature co-exist in harmony. This is the vision of a Solar Punk Martian colony, where green energy and sustainable living are at the core of our society.</p>
            <p>Flying to Mars is an extraordinary adventure. The journey begins with boarding a spacecraft designed to sustain human life for the duration of the trip. As we leave Earth, we watch our home planet become a small blue dot, a humbling reminder of the vastness of space.</p>
            <p>During the journey, the spacecraft is a hub of activity. Scientists and engineers monitor the systems, ensuring everything operates smoothly. Passengers engage in various activities, from educational workshops about space and Mars to recreational facilities designed to keep the mind and body healthy.</p>
            <p>Upon arrival, the Martian landscape is unlike anything seen on Earth. Red deserts stretch as far as the eye can see, but within our domes, lush greenery thrives. Solar panels and wind turbines dot the horizon, harnessing renewable energy to power our new homes.</p>
            <p>Living on Mars challenges us to think differently about our environment and resources. Every drop of water is precious, and waste is meticulously recycled. The Solar Punk philosophy drives us to innovate and find new ways to live sustainably, creating a community that respects the delicate balance of nature.</p>
            <p>The adventure of flying to Mars and building a new world is just the beginning. Together, we explore, learn, and grow, turning the dream of a harmonious and sustainable future into a reality.</p>
